# What was done by each member
HW1 (FirstPerson):
Completed each section of the assignment, also added custom health bars to each target to show the 
user how much health each target has left.

HW2 (Vr):
Completed each section, also added a counter on the gun for how many targets are left to show the
player what the win condition is.
